<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm passionate about software development and I'm looking forward to getting to work on new projects in the near future.
  I have been working with Java, Python, HTML/CSS Bootstrap and SQL with database analysis and design, have interest in 
  local community development and enjoy programming, composing songs(play drums, acoustic guitar and lid guitar).
  To keep fit, ice skating is a way to go and enjoy doing outdoor activities such as cycling and hiking.
